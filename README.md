## Backend setup

Pre-requisite: Java 8, Apache Tomcat (v8.0 or up)

2) Open Database perspective on Eclipse and then initialize a new `Derby` database and then make a note of the JDBC url (The path to the database URL)

3) The database created in Step 2 can be populated with all the tables/data by running the `onlineBookStoreScript.sql` file inside of the database-schema-and-scripts folder

4) Update the `context.xml` to ensure that the jdbc `url` is replaced with the path to the new database that was created in Step 2.

5) Start up the server and then hit the base localhost URL generated by the Tomcat Server.
